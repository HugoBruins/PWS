## Arduino Code

For the Arduino code, you will need to install the libraries 'Accelstepper' and Wire.h and upload to an Arduino Nano via the IDE software.

## Python Code

In chapter 1 of our school project we used figures to explain PID, these figures have the same numbers as the python programs used to make them. 

## Instructions to recreate the plots

1. Check what figure you want to recreate, search the code with the same name (say figure 12, load `PID fig12.py`.
2. Run the code.
3. Change the variable names to the second color of the plot (for figure 12 specifically you will need to uncomment lines `24` & `25` of the code).
4. Run the code.
5. Change the constants and run the code again (without closing the plot) if there are multiple lines in one graph.
